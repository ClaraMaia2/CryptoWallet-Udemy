# CryptoWallet

## Program developed by me while doing a Ruby on Rails course on the platform Udemy. 

This is a simple web application, consisting of a wallet that can be used for the tracking of cryptocoins. 

Coins can be added, modified, showed and deleted at any time. There is also a page for the types of mining these coins, and it is directly linked with the coins. Therefore, when seeing a coin, users can also the mining type of that specific coin.
